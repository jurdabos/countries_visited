# Testing Approach for Countries Visited Map

This document explains the approach used to test if the Countries Visited Map application is running correctly, with a focus on authentication login and map display functionality.

## Testing Goals

The primary goals of the testing approach are to verify:

1. **Application Startup**: Ensure the app starts correctly without errors
2. **Authentication**: Verify the login functionality works properly
3. **Map Display**: Confirm that maps are displayed correctly
4. **Core Functionality**: Test that the basic features of the application work as expected

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy combines automated checks with manual verification:

### 1. Automated Checks

The test scripts perform several automated checks:

- **Environment Verification**: Check if all required dependencies are installed
- **Directory Structure**: Verify that all required directories and files exist
- **System Compatibility**: Display system information to identify potential compatibility issues
- **Process Monitoring**: Capture and display any errors from the Streamlit process

### 2. Manual Verification

Some aspects of the application require manual verification:

- **Visual Confirmation**: Verify that the map displays correctly with proper colors and interactions
- **Authentication Flow**: Test the login process and confirm successful authentication
- **User Interaction**: Test selecting countries and verifying they appear on the map
- **Mode Switching**: Verify that both Single Player and Multi Player modes work correctly

## Test Scripts

The testing approach is implemented through several scripts:

1. **ensure_directories.py**: Verifies and creates the required directory structure
2. **test_app_manual.py**: Basic test that starts the app for manual verification
3. **test_app_comprehensive.py**: More thorough test with dependency and file checks
4. **run_all_tests.py**: Master script that runs all tests in sequence

## Testing Process

The recommended testing process is:

1. Run `run_all_tests.py` to perform a complete verification
2. Follow the manual verification steps displayed during the test
3. Check the test summary to see if all tests passed
4. If issues are found, refer to the troubleshooting guidance in the README

## Interpreting Results

The test results should be interpreted as follows:

- **All Tests Pass**: The application is running correctly with authentication and maps displaying properly
- **Directory Structure Check Fails**: Required directories or files are missing
- **Dependency Check Fails**: Some required packages are not installed
- **App Startup Fails**: The application cannot start due to errors
- **Manual Verification Fails**: The application starts but has functional issues

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

The most common issues that might prevent the app from running correctly are:

1. **Missing Dependencies**: Install missing packages with `pip install -e .`
2. **File Access Issues**: Ensure all required files are in the correct locations
3. **Map Display Issues**: Verify that folium and streamlit-folium are installed correctly
4. **Authentication Issues**: For testing, use the "Login as Demo User" option

## Conclusion

This testing approach provides a comprehensive way to verify that the Countries Visited Map application is running correctly, with particular attention to authentication login and map display functionality. By following the recommended testing process, users can quickly identify and resolve any issues that might prevent the application from working as expected.
